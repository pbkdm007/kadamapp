1
00:00:01.240 --> 00:00:04.485
The global mentality
is moving toward free

2
00:00:04.510 --> 00:00:07.904
world trade and increased
market liberalism.

3
00:00:08.820 --> 00:00:13.540
A world full of opportunities.
A world where dreams can come true.

4
00:00:13.840 --> 00:00:17.640
It sounds fantastic,
and it is fantastic.

5
00:00:18.940 --> 00:00:20.780
For a very small percentage of us.

6
00:00:21.680 --> 00:00:26.735
But for the vast, poor
majority, the capitalist

7
00:00:26.760 --> 00:00:32.024
system only means one
thing: death and suffering.

8
00:00:32.560 --> 00:00:39.340
While we live out our days thoughtlessly,
and stuff ourselves with cheap food..

9
00:00:39.580 --> 00:00:43.260
The poor people of the earth struggle
in factories.

10
00:00:43.540 --> 00:00:47.719
Wages are forced down to the minimum,
while the work hours keep increasing.

11
00:00:47.720 --> 00:00:51.559
Unionization is illegal,
and the working conditions are intolerable.

12
00:00:51.560 --> 00:00:56.539
Before applauding freedom,
we must remember one thing:

13
00:00:56.540 --> 00:01:00.800
Our over consummating society stands on the
shoulders of the coffee beans from Peru.

14
00:01:00.840 --> 00:01:07.120
We gorge on cheap food produced
by underpaid children's hands from India-

15
00:01:10.660 --> 00:01:12.860
Was it good?
- So good!

16
00:01:13.120 --> 00:01:17.520
Should I change the title to:
Working conditions are inhumane?

17
00:01:17.780 --> 00:01:20.700
- No, it was good the way it was.
- Yeah?

18
00:01:21.060 --> 00:01:24.580
Are there other things you thought of?

19
00:01:27.480 --> 00:01:31.500
You know you wrote
"gorge on cheap food" twice in a row?

20
00:01:31.740 --> 00:01:33.680
Maybe you could change that.

21
00:01:34.380 --> 00:01:36.540
No, that's the point.
To write it twice.

22
00:01:36.680 --> 00:01:40.960
I use repetition as a
literary tool to emphasize...

23
00:01:54.720 --> 00:01:56.940
- Was it good?
- Yeah, that was good.

24
00:01:57.120 --> 00:01:58.440
Cleverly written.

25
00:02:07.360 --> 00:02:08.440
I got a 5.

26
00:02:09.720 --> 00:02:12.380
5+? Nice. Really good!

27
00:02:12.760 --> 00:02:14.140
Eva, what did you get?

28
00:02:15.140 --> 00:02:16.920
I don't want to talk about it.

29
00:02:16.980 --> 00:02:19.641
The thing is, is that
Jonas is your boyfriend.

30
00:02:19.653 --> 00:02:21.700
So you have to tell
him everything,

31
00:02:21.880 --> 00:02:25.339
and Jonas tells me everything.
So I'll know anyway.

32
00:02:25.340 --> 00:02:26.340
It's true.

33
00:02:27.220 --> 00:02:29.900
Okay, yeah.
I got a 4 minus.

34
00:02:31.560 --> 00:02:33.340
You got a 4 minus?

35
00:02:34.020 --> 00:02:38.040
That's bad. -Yeah, yeah. You're
good a a lot of other things.

36
00:02:38.520 --> 00:02:41.776
You're able to dress
yourself, you can brush

37
00:02:41.788 --> 00:02:44.620
your teeth by yourself.
Think of that.

38
00:02:49.340 --> 00:02:50.600
Jonas, we're leaving.

39
00:02:50.840 --> 00:02:51.740
- Now?
- Yeah.

40
00:02:51.741 --> 00:02:53.740
- Where are you going?
- To Elias.

41
00:02:57.560 --> 00:02:59.500
- I'll call you later.
- Okay.

42
00:04:11.720 --> 00:04:13.780
<i>[Phone is turned off...]</i>

43
00:04:25.140 --> 00:04:26.440
- Hello!
- Hey!

44
00:04:26.600 --> 00:04:28.920
- What's up?
- Nothing special, really.

45
00:04:29.040 --> 00:04:31.320
- Are you with Jonas?
- No, not now.

46
00:04:31.580 --> 00:04:33.240
Weren't you going to Elias?

47
00:04:33.800 --> 00:04:35.780
Yeah but that was a while ago.

48
00:04:38.580 --> 00:04:43.260
Did you see Sara's picture?
I think she got fake lashes.

49
00:04:43.620 --> 00:04:47.440
- No!
- Yeah, check the picture on Facebook.

50
00:04:49.960 --> 00:04:51.980
Have you heard they
started their bus already?

51
00:04:53.240 --> 00:04:53.860
No.

52
00:04:53.861 --> 00:04:56.800
One month into high school
and they started their bus.

53
00:04:57.180 --> 00:04:58.240
With who?

54
00:04:59.120 --> 00:05:01.480
With Rodrigues maybe,
they're calling themselves Papsi Max.

55
00:05:07.520 --> 00:05:09.540
You know you can
just talk to her, right?

56
00:05:09.740 --> 00:05:10.800
She doesn't bite.

57
00:05:12.080 --> 00:05:13.559
Jonas is here.
I have to go.

58
00:05:13.560 --> 00:05:14.900
What are you gonna do?

59
00:05:30.860 --> 00:05:34.400
I tried to call you,
but you never answered your phone.

60
00:05:35.460 --> 00:05:36.820
My battery was dead.

61
00:05:37.000 --> 00:05:40.180
- Can't you just charge it at home?
- I wasn't home.

62
00:05:41.220 --> 00:05:42.460
Where were you then?

63
00:05:42.600 --> 00:05:44.320
I was at Elias'.

64
00:05:44.500 --> 00:05:45.500
Until now?

65
00:05:46.620 --> 00:05:51.320
I talked to Isak. He said
you guys left Elias' a long time ago.

66
00:05:52.280 --> 00:05:56.480
So many questions!
Isak left, I stayed.

67
00:05:56.760 --> 00:05:58.280
Don't you trust me?

68
00:06:00.000 --> 00:06:01.860
Don't you trust me?

69
00:06:02.240 --> 00:06:03.240
Huh?

70
00:06:03.720 --> 00:06:05.420
Why don't you trust me?

71
00:06:11.420 --> 00:06:15.220
- 3+? You said you got a 4 minus!
- It's almost the same.

72
00:06:15.300 --> 00:06:17.540
"Whoever has expelled..."
- Jonas!

73
00:06:20.380 --> 00:06:25.400
"Must be blamed for their behavior."
- Jonas!

74
00:06:31.780 --> 00:06:34.880
"A state one experiences"?
That was really sweet.

75
00:06:37.120 --> 00:06:39.900
- What do you think you're doing?
- A kiss.

76
00:07:21.900 --> 00:07:24.260
- What's your name?
- Ingrid.

77
00:07:24.960 --> 00:07:27.740
- Are you guys in the same class.
- 1STA, yeah.

78
00:07:28.140 --> 00:07:30.120
It costs 10 Kroner per ticket.

79
00:07:34.320 --> 00:07:36.920
It'll be good.
Are you guys excited?

80
00:07:41.660 --> 00:07:42.660
Hi!

81
00:07:42.900 --> 00:07:44.560
Will you be at the show?

82
00:07:45.300 --> 00:07:48.840
We're from the theater
group, and we want to have you!

83
00:07:53.180 --> 00:07:55.340
What do you do at the theater group?

84
00:08:06.120 --> 00:08:09.260
We have a pre-party tomorrow.
Are you going to the party?

85
00:08:10.800 --> 00:08:13.060
You have to, everyone will go!

86
00:08:13.220 --> 00:08:16.379
You're a first year. This is
when you'll lay the foundation

87
00:08:16.391 --> 00:08:18.980
for your social future for
the next three years!

88
00:08:19.120 --> 00:08:20.120
Wake up!

89
00:08:23.220 --> 00:08:26.780
But if you want to be at
the pre-party, add me on Facebook.

90
00:08:27.000 --> 00:08:29.020
Argentina etc.

91
00:08:38.220 --> 00:08:39.980
I don't think anyone actually likes him.

92
00:08:40.540 --> 00:08:45.040
When the teacher asks obvious questions...

93
00:08:45.380 --> 00:08:46.380
Hey you...

94
00:08:46.700 --> 00:08:48.260
Can't we go to the party?

95
00:08:48.380 --> 00:08:49.520
Why?

96
00:08:49.820 --> 00:08:55.000
Because the entire school is going.
And we are first years.

97
00:08:55.180 --> 00:08:58.580
This is when we have to
lay the foundation for our social life.

98
00:08:58.700 --> 00:09:00.800
Foundation for our social life?

99
00:09:02.660 --> 00:09:05.860
Come on! It'll be so much fun!

100
00:09:08.660 --> 00:09:12.040
- I promise.
- Yeah okay, I'll come.

101
00:09:12.660 --> 00:09:15.880
If... Isak can come
to the cabin next week.

102
00:09:19.180 --> 00:09:25.120
I know it was supposed to be just the
two of us, but Isak has nothing to do.

103
00:09:25.480 --> 00:09:27.920
He'll just walk around,
completely by himself.

104
00:09:30.780 --> 00:09:32.740
You can take a friend as well.

105
00:09:44.180 --> 00:09:45.180
What do you say?

106
00:09:47.340 --> 00:09:50.040
Okay, Isak can come.

107
00:09:50.100 --> 00:09:51.160
Come to what?

108
00:09:51.520 --> 00:09:52.960
The cabin, man!

109
00:09:53.260 --> 00:09:55.520
Cabin? I'm going to the cabin?

110
00:09:56.160 --> 00:09:58.760
On one condition..

111
00:09:58.960 --> 00:10:01.020
That you guys come to the party tomorrow.

112
00:10:01.320 --> 00:10:02.340
We can't.

113
00:10:02.860 --> 00:10:04.100
Why not?

114
00:10:04.240 --> 00:10:06.000
Kindred Fever tickets.

115
00:10:07.920 --> 00:10:09.880
I completely forgot!

116
00:10:10.300 --> 00:10:13.620
Seriously, I didn't even remember it.

117
00:13:22.680 --> 00:13:24.220
Hi! You came!

118
00:14:28.520 --> 00:14:30.600
You can't ignore me forever.

119
00:14:30.880 --> 00:14:32.940
We're bound to talk.

120
00:14:42.280 --> 00:14:43.300
Ingrid...

121
00:14:45.320 --> 00:14:46.340
I miss you.

122
00:14:50.140 --> 00:14:51.560
Say something.

123
00:14:53.380 --> 00:14:55.319
I would've lost the eyeliner.

124
00:14:55.320 --> 00:14:56.840
You look like a slut.

125
00:14:58.840 --> 00:14:59.880
She snapped.

126
00:15:04.760 --> 00:15:06.040
NOORA

127
00:15:10.380 --> 00:15:13.040
We have Spanish together. Noora.

128
00:15:13.520 --> 00:15:14.580
Eva.

129
00:15:17.300 --> 00:15:23.720
Girls who call other girls sluts have
90% higher chance of getting chlamydia.

130
00:15:24.300 --> 00:15:25.300
Seriously?

131
00:15:25.560 --> 00:15:26.560
No.

132
00:15:27.120 --> 00:15:29.020
But it would've
been cool if it were true.

133
00:16:20.680 --> 00:16:21.980
Are you okay, or?

134
00:16:22.180 --> 00:16:23.900
Yeah... Yeah.

135
00:16:31.360 --> 00:16:33.120
Are you sure?

136
00:16:37.560 --> 00:16:38.920
Maybe...

137
00:16:40.420 --> 00:16:42.720
Maybe I can get a friend?

138
00:16:47.280 --> 00:16:48.900
Can you maybe get Chris?

139
00:16:49.340 --> 00:16:50.380
Chris?

140
00:18:03.420 --> 00:18:06.920
It was 40.000 Kroner.
I don't have that money!

141
00:18:06.960 --> 00:18:09.740
It's toilet paper, Vilde! Toilet paper!

142
00:18:09.840 --> 00:18:11.540
It's not that bad.

143
00:18:11.820 --> 00:18:14.200
We're not going to use
that much toilet paper.

144
00:18:14.460 --> 00:18:19.280
I don't mean to interrupt,
but I got Chris for you.

145
00:18:19.780 --> 00:18:20.800
Here I am!

146
00:18:24.900 --> 00:18:26.840
- This is Chris.
- I am Chris.

147
00:18:29.800 --> 00:18:31.300
Are you also called Chris?

148
00:18:31.580 --> 00:18:33.440
Oh my god!

149
00:18:33.580 --> 00:18:35.600
- Twin names!
- Yeah, twin names!

150
00:18:50.320 --> 00:18:53.160
We were actually in
the middle of something...

151
00:18:54.260 --> 00:18:56.720
Yes, of course.

152
00:18:58.080 --> 00:18:59.620
Come, we're going.

153
00:18:59.700 --> 00:19:01.440
What happened?
We're not going to talk?

154
00:19:02.100 --> 00:19:03.540
You! Where are you going?

155
00:19:04.080 --> 00:19:06.180
Don't be a dick tease.
